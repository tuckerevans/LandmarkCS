Landmark CS Assignments
=======================
Compiled February 2019

This is a collection of all of my Computer Science assignments at
Landmark College.

All assignments that were in a git repo were joined using a edited
copy of this script:
<https://gist.github.com/detunized/7c41718863ab94e7072f99a55a5bf9d4>
(Other assignments are included in their final form).
These classes were taken before I understood how to use git, please
excuse the poor/non-existent commit quality.

CS2771 : Embedded Systems (Fall 2017)
CS3871 : Operating Systems (Fall 2017)
CSC2621: Web Science (Fall 2017)
